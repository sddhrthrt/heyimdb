A simple tool based on "secret" IMDB urls to get the IMDB ratings of a movie.

This tool currently can search with the exact/approx movie name and print it's
rating.

How to use:
  python heyimdb.py --help
  #prints the help menu \m/optparse!
  python heyimdb.py The Butler
  #returns the rating of the movie if movie found, otherwise displays near
  #results. As of now, find the proper name of the movie and search again.

TODO:
 - to add options (currently added, but options dont work)
 - coprehensive suite (rating, cast, summary)
 - better URLs to get data from
